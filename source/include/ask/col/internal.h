 * single-linked-list that is used in kernel. It is used at very many places, so that its really
 * worth it. To achieve that, we use the dynamic-array and dedicate an area in virtual-memory to
 * the nodes. This area is extended on demand and all nodes are put in a freelist (they have a
 * next-element anyway). This is much quicker than using the heap everytime a node is allocated or
 * free'd. That means, if we put no heap-allocated data in the sll (so data, that does exist
 * anyway), using it does basically cost nothing :) */
